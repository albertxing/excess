## Contributing

If you find any bugs or have a cool idea, feel free to create an issue.

Also, I encourage you to contribute any bug fixes or enhancements, small or large. Just fork the repository, commit your changes, and submit a pull request.

### Why... is your code lacking documentation??

I originally intended this to be a small personal project, and worked on it on and off over a period of a few months. If you have any questions about the code, just ask (create an issue).
